1.	Data is directly imported into Jupyternotebook by using Yahoo finance API, hence the code and data are in 1 single ipynb file. Use the option ‘Restart kernel and run all cell’ is suggested, in case ‘run all cell’ option does not work.
2.	Paper and its supplementary file are submitted together with the code file.
3.	Regarding methodology implemented in code. E.g: GARCH (1,1) and GO-GARCH, please read the methodology given in the paper and its supplementary file given by the authors.
4.	All results in the presentation are taken from the finance_project_official.ipynb. Data in the tables are collected in the results cell manually,e.g: collecting results of GARCH (1,1), since copying the whole GARCH model results and paste into the presentation slides is not a good idea
